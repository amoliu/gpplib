0 Introduction

DockserverTalk is a python module that facilitates to build applications
that can talk directly to a Teledyne WebbResearch dockserver. The most
simple example is to intercept all the dialogue for a particalur glider. A
bit more advanced is to parse that output and take specific actions, depending
on what the dialogue between dockserver and glider is. A future application is
to automate the communication with a glider by bypassing the use of the 
well-known and generally despised dockserver xml scripts.

Requirements:

The dockserverTalk module depends on other python modules that are either standard
or included with the source.
