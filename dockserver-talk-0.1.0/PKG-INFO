                        dockserver-talk
        
        Dockserver-talk is a python package intended for communication with a Slocum glider
        dockserver. 
        
        
        Two applications that have been built using this package:
        
        B.UG.S: an application to track  buoys, underwater gliders and ships, respective to a reference 
                location (e.g. a ship)
        
        Surfalarm : an application that interfaces with a (GSM) modem. It can send text messages, or 
                    initiate phone calls, depending on particular strings seen in the glider dialogs.
